## Local development

- Backend (SQLite dev):
	- cd backend
	- python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
	- pip install -r requirements.txt
	- export USE_SQLITE=true
	- python manage.py migrate
	- python manage.py runserver

- Frontend:
	- cd frontend
	- npm ci
	- npm run dev

## Production configuration

Copy `.env.production.example` to your environment (or secret manager) and set values:

- DEBUG=False
- SECRET_KEY: long, random, kept secret
- ALLOWED_HOSTS: your domain(s)
- Database: POSTGRES_DB/USER/PASSWORD/HOST/PORT
- CORS/CSRF: include your frontend origin(s)
- HTTPS: SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True, HSTS enabled, secure cookies
- If behind a proxy: SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER=HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO:https

Then:

- Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- Collect static: `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
- Run under Gunicorn/Uvicorn with a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) serving static and forwarding to Django.

Frontend production:

- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your API URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/api)
- Build with `npm run build` and serve `frontend/dist` via your web server or CDN.

## Deployment notes

- Use a process manager (systemd, Supervisor) to run Gunicorn/Uvicorn.
- Put Nginx/Caddy in front to terminate TLS and serve static assets with proper caching.
- Set the security env vars from `.env.production.example`.
- Enable logging/monitoring, database backups, and periodic security updates.
