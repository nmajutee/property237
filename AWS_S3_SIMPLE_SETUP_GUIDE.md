### Option 1: Test in Browser
1. Open a new browser tab
2. Copy and paste this URL:
```
https://property237-media.s3.amazonaws.com/property_images/appartment_at_st_luke_street_buea.jpg
```
3. Press Enter
4. **You should see the image!** (Not an error page)

### Option 2: Check Your Website
1. Go to your Property237 website
2. Refresh the page (press F5)

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the Permissions tab"
- Make sure you clicked on your bucket name: `property237-media`
- You should see tabs: Objects, Properties, **Permissions**, Metrics, etc.

### "I get an error when saving"
- Make sure you copied the **entire** JSON text (including the curly braces `{}`)
- Check there are no extra spaces or characters

### "Images still don't show"
1. Wait 1-2 minutes (AWS needs time to apply changes)
2. Clear your browser cache: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Try the direct image URL test above

### "I don't have AWS account access"
- You need the AWS account credentials that were used to create the `property237-media` bucket
- Check your email for AWS account setup or ask whoever set up your AWS account

## What You Just Did (Explanation)

- ‚úÖ **Unblocked public access**: Told AWS it's OK for people to view files
- ‚úÖ **Added bucket policy**: Created a rule that says "anyone can VIEW files" (but not delete or modify)
- ‚úÖ **Setup CORS**: Told AWS to allow your website to load images from S3

**Security Note**: This setup is safe! Users can only:
- ‚úÖ View/download images via direct URL
- ‚ùå Cannot upload files
- ‚ùå Cannot delete files
- ‚ùå Cannot see list of all files
- ‚ùå Cannot modify anything

This is the **standard setup** for websites with user-uploaded images (like Airbnb, Instagram, etc.)
