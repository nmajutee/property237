**Missing Cameroon-Specific Fields:**
- ❌ `distance_from_main_road`
- ❌ `road_is_tarred`
- ❌ `vehicle_access`
- ❌ `electricity_type` (Private/Shared Meter)
- ❌ `electricity_payment` (Prepaid/Postpaid)
- ❌ `water_type` (Camwater/Forage)
- ❌ `has_generator`
- ❌ `no_of_living_rooms` (parlours)
- ❌ `kitchen_type` (Full Size/Partial)
- ❌ `initial_months_payable` (1-24 months)
- ❌ `caution_months` (0-12 months deposit)
- ❌ `visit_fee`
