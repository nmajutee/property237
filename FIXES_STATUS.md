# 🚀 FIXES DEPLOYED - Action Plan

## ✅ What's Fixed (Just Pushed)

1. **Edit Property Page "Failed to fetch" Error** - FIXED ✅
   - Changed `localhost:8000` to production API
   - Now using `getApiBaseUrl()` correctly
   - Changed PUT to PATCH for updates

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### 1. Delete Property Not Working
**Status**: Investigating
**What to do**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try to delete a property
3. Look for red error messages
4. Send me the exact error text

**Possible causes**:
- Permission issue (backend rejecting delete)
- Token expired
- Network error

### 2. Edit Form Fields Don't Match Add Form
**Status**: Known issue
**Root cause**: Edit page uses old field structure (city, state, zip_code) but backend uses new structure (area, property_type objects, etc.)

**Solution options**:
A. **Quick fix**: Disable edit button temporarily, tell users to delete and recreate
B. **Proper fix**: Rewrite edit page to match add-property page (20-30 minutes)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### After Vercel Deployment Completes (~2 min):

#### Test 1: Edit Property "Failed to fetch" - SHOULD BE FIXED ✅
1. Go to My Properties
2. Click **Edit** on any property
3. **Should see**: Property data loads (no "Failed to fetch" error)
4. **Note**: Fields may not match exactly yet (that's the next fix)

####Test 2: Delete Property - NEEDS YOUR HELP 🐛
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Go to My Properties
3. Click trash icon on a test property
4. Click OK on confirmation dialog
5. **Watch console for errors**
6. **Send me**:
   - Console errors (red text)
   - Network tab response (if any)
   - What alert message shows

## 💡 Quick Solutions

### For Delete Issue:

**Option A**: If it's a permission error:
```python
# Backend might need adjustment
# I'll fix the permission check
```

**Option B**: If it's a token issue:
- Logout and login again
- Try delete again

**Option C**: If it's an API error:
- Check Render logs for backend error
- Send me the error details

### For Edit Form:

**Option A - Quick (5 min)**:
- Hide/disable Edit button for now
- Add tooltip: "Delete and recreate property to edit"

**Option B - Proper (30 min)**:

## 🎯 Priority Actions

### RIGHT NOW:
